# Lab 3 – Developing with Bootstrap

This lab refactors my previous Frontend Mentor project — the **QR Code Component** — to use **Bootstrap 5.3** for consistent styling, maintainability, and responsive design.

## Project Refactored
1. **QR Code Component**
   - Replaced custom CSS with Bootstrap utility classes.
   - Used `.card` and `.d-flex` for layout and centering.
   - Achieved responsive design with minimal custom code.

## Tools and Frameworks
- [Bootstrap 5.3](https://getbootstrap.com/)
- HTML5 and ARIA accessibility practices
- Google Fonts (Outfit & Figtree)

## What I Learned
- How to replace custom CSS with **Bootstrap utility classes** efficiently.
- How to use Bootstrap’s **grid system and cards** for clean, responsive layouts.
- How to combine **custom styling sparingly** for brand consistency.
